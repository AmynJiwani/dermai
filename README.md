This project is based on a previous work experience in the summer of 2023. During this experience, I worked for the Aga Khan Development Network's Digital Health Resource Centre, where I gathered a dataset that was to be used for an AI/ML identification project.

However, the programming behind this tool was beyond the scope of my internship, but it was at the beginning of July that I wanted to challenge myself - after being interested in AI and looking into classification tools, could I program one myself, using the data I collected? This project serves as a practical use case of what I've learned, and while it's still **currently a work in progress**, I hope to be able to showcase a visual representation of my work soon.

In the meantime, the attached script is what I've come up with so far - I've broken it down into the steps I wish to see implemented - but my biggest challenge at the moment is recognizing the dataset using Tensorflow - something I have limited experience with. I hope to update this README (which is effectively serving as a personal progress log of sorts) soon with more progress. 

Thanks for reading!
